          <p class="description"><strong>D</strong>uring this decade, in the aftermath of the Space Race, came a new period of global cooperation when it came to exploring the new frontier beyond our planet. The rampant public interest in space was at an all-time high, funding was flowing and advancements were being made with an unseen rapidity.

          <p>Thanks to NASA, we can see the effect this era of space exploration has had on the field. Take a look at some of the images that never would have been taken if it weren't for an era of enthusiasm surrounding space.</p>
