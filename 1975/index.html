          <p class="description">
             <strong>T</strong>he 1970's and 80's were rife with political action, activism and aggression. Between the 'end' of the Vietnam war, Reagan's election, and Reagan's re-election, they were politically heavy times.

              <br><strong>T</strong>his decade would mark the beginning of wide-spread, American-led, global capitalsm. With Reagenomics catching on and being spread into the SOuth American countries, the 1980's would be a decade of American influence and experimentation.</br></p>

          <p class="description"><strong>D</strong>uring this decade, in the aftermath of the Space Race, came a new period of global cooperation when it came to exploring the new frontier beyond our planet. The rampant public interest in space was at an all-time high, funding was flowing and advancements were being made with an unseen rapidity. Between the launches of multiple space stations and the first deep space probes, the 1970's and 80's brought humans closer to the stars than ever before.</p>

          <p>Thanks to NASA, we can see the effect this era of space exploration has had on the field. Take a look at some of the images that never would have been taken if it weren't for an era of enthusiasm surrounding space.</p>

        <h2>Pop Culture</h2>
        <p><strong>T</strong>he pop culture of the 1970's and 80's was counter-cultural, edgy and new. The activism of the previous decades was becoming more main-stream and seeping into media, music and journalism. <br>
        <strong>N</strong>ew franchises such as Star Wars and Star Trek were forward thinking and futuristic, everything way aimed at a better and brighter future. Bands such as Queen, Fleetwood Mac and The Rolling Stones were taking the world by storm with their music aimed at hippes and leftists. There was change in the culture, even if the politics didn't reflect that. </br></p>
