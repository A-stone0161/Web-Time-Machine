        <p class="description"> During this decade, in the aftermath of the Space Race, came a new period of global cooperation when it came to exploring the new frontier beyond our planet. The rampant public interest in space was at an all-time high, funding was flowing and advancements were being made with an unseen rapidity. Between the launches of multiple space stations and the first deep space probes, the 1970's and 80's brought humans closer to the stars than ever before.</p>

        <p>Thanks to NASA, we can see the effect this era of space exploration has had on the field. Take a look at some of the images that never would have been taken if it weren't for an era of enthusiasm surrounding space.</p>
